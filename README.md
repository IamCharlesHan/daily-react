Let’s take baby steps. If you want to learn something, build something, and achieve a goal, you have to start somewhere. I’ve been keeping an eye on [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for a while but I never made the commitment to really start using them. Here is my solution: small bit of react code every day.
